### Hi there 👋

I am a software developer based on Brazil skilled in **PHP**, **Laravel** and **Ruby on Rails**. 

🔭
I'm currently working on *Leroy Merlin*'s e-commerce. *Leroy Merlin* is a huge retail company from France that has a presence in Brazil too. 
We are responsible to handle customer's data and their experience in our platform. There is more than 5 million happy customers out there 😄.

🌱
I'm also working on a side project that will be lauched soon. *Melhor Preço* is a pricing platform for e-commerce sellers to calculate their profit in plataforms like Amazon, Shopee, Mercado Livre and AliExpress.
